The 307 Temporary Security Conference was born as a “temporary redirect” from H2HC, created by members of the cybersecurity community to keep alive the gathering for everyone who had already planned to be in São Paulo. It is an independent, collaborative, 100% volunteer-driven event, organized by people involved in initiatives such as BSides São Paulo, BXSec, and You Sh0t the Sheriff, with no sponsorship and free admission.

The goal is to bring the community together for two days of technical content, knowledge sharing, and hands-on information security. We will have at least one track of talks, space for multiple villages, and a CTF. As the program and venue are confirmed, this page will be updated with information for those who want to attend, support, speak at, or collaborate with the 307 Temporary Security Conference.
