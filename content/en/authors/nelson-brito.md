Nelson Brito is a Brazilian cybersecurity researcher with more than two decades of experience in the field, specializing in reverse engineering, vulnerability analysis, network infrastructure testing, and denial-of-service (DoS/DDoS) attacks.

He is the creator of the T50 tool — a multi-protocol packet injector designed to perform stress tests on networks and security environments.

Throughout his career, Nelson has also been a speaker at national and international conferences and was the only Brazilian invited to present at the PH-Neutral conference in Berlin.

In his professional work, he combines strong technical expertise with excellent communication and advisory skills, helping organizations strengthen their defenses against modern threats such as ransomware, espionage, and emerging vulnerabilities.

Nelson is also known for his ethical stance: although his T50 tool has been misused by third parties in attacks, he has taken a firm position against such use and advocates that it be employed only in controlled environments for testing and research purposes.
