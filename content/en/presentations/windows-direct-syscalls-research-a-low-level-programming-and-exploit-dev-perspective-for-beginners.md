In this talk, Carolina Trigo will show how to conduct a study on *Windows Internals* focused on understanding the internal mechanisms of *direct syscalls*. The session leverages advanced research from security professionals to explore low-level concepts in an accessible way.

The presentation covers reverse engineering, debugging, and exploit development techniques, showing how curiosity can be a driver for hands-on learning. The goal is to offer an introductory and didactic overview for those who wish to start their journey into low-level research and exploitation within the Windows ecosystem.
