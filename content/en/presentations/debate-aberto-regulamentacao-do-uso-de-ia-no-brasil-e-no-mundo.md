This session proposes an in-depth and essential discussion on the paths of Artificial Intelligence (AI) regulation, examining both the Brazilian legal landscape and the international regulatory framework.

The central focus is Brazil’s Bill No. 2338/2023, known as the *AI Legal Framework*, which aims to establish principles, rights, and duties for the development and use of AI systems in Brazil. Topics include risk classification, accountability, and the creation of a competent regulatory authority.

The debate also expands to international standards, highlighting the ISO/IEC 27090 series, which addresses AI risk management requirements, and ISO/IEC 27091, focused on ethics and AI impact assessment. The goal is to foster a critical discussion on governance, security, and the responsible use of Artificial Intelligence.
