Quantum computers operate as if they were testing parallel paths of the universe, bringing power and danger in equal measure. This capability fundamentally reshapes the information security landscape, especially when it comes to cryptography and traditional protection models.

In this talk, Wolmer Godoi guides the audience through this computational “multiverse,” exploring the impact of quantum computing on cryptographic attacks and discussing the technologies emerging to keep systems secure — or that may ultimately fall short in doing so.
