In this talk, Nelson Brito shares discoveries and lessons learned over years of working with vulnerability reverse engineering, presenting practical techniques and a workflow designed to help professionals advance their skills.

The session includes in-depth details of research that led to updating the description of CVE-2008-4844, incorporating relevant information that had been previously overlooked. Additionally, Nelson will live-demo the reverse engineering of a *client-side* vulnerability, resulting in the discovery of a new exploitation vector capable of bypassing Microsoft workarounds and intrusion detection signatures from multiple vendors.

The talk connects research, offensive practice, and critical analysis, offering a realistic view of how vulnerabilities emerge, evolve, and remain exploitable even in the face of modern defenses.
