Since 2018, Thiago José Lucas has been working at LARS — the Advanced Laboratory in Computer Networks Security at UNESP — conducting research on intrusion detection powered by Machine Learning. The laboratory, linked to CNPq, develops studies involving network traffic analysis and RAM dump analysis to identify attacks with greater accuracy.

Recently, his team identified a pruning technique based on diversity that significantly improves IDS defenses. The approach led to national and international publications and was the central theme of his master’s, doctorate, and postdoctorate. The method makes it possible to detect attacks with low computational cost and a high accuracy rate, making it especially attractive for environments that require efficiency and scalability.

In the talk, Thiago presents the fundamentals of ensemble learning applied to security, demonstrates the gains achieved with the pruning technique, and shares the results of the research developed at LARS, offering a practical view of how to optimize intrusion detection systems.
