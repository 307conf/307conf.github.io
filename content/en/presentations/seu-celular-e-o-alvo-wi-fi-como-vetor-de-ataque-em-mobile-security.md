In this talk, Edson Ferreira provides a practical view of how public Wi-Fi networks and misconfigured home routers expose vulnerabilities that put all smartphone activity at risk. The presentation walks the audience through classic attack techniques such as Evil Twin, deauthentication attacks, and WPA2 handshake capture, explaining why these attacks continue to succeed in real-world scenarios.

Beyond the offensive side, the talk also covers mitigation and defense, including OWASP MSTG best practices, infrastructure hardening (such as disabling WPS), and recommendations for software and firmware used in security testing. The session introduces a low-cost and accessible tool for enthusiasts who want to experience offensive security in controlled environments.  
This talk is aimed at beginner to intermediate audiences, including students and technology and security enthusiasts.
