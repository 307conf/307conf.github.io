In this research, Bruno Sena demonstrates how techniques traditionally used in game cheats — such as DLL manipulation and function hooking in the Mono Runtime, widely used by Unity-based games — can be applied to exploit critical functions in Android applications.

By abusing these techniques, an attacker can alter execution flows, access protected resources, and manipulate sensitive data using an approach that differs from traditional Android reverse engineering. The presentation details the implementation of these techniques, explores protection bypass scenarios, and demonstrates a practical attack against a popular password manager application available on the Play Store.
