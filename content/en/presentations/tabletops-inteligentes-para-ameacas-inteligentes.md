This talk proposes the design and execution of *tabletop exercises* (TTEs) focused on security incident scenarios involving Artificial Intelligence systems. The session explores how traditional incident response exercises can be adapted to include AI-specific threats, such as algorithmic failures, automated decision risks, and intelligent adversarial behavior.

Innovative methodologies are presented to simulate attacks, unexpected model behaviors, and emerging risk scenarios, enabling both technical and executive teams to test processes, communication, and decision-making. The goal is to help organizations assess resilience and improve preparedness against intelligent, AI-driven threats.
