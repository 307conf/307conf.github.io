The talk presents possible attacks involving IoT devices built on the ESP32 family of microcontrollers, showing how these platforms can become relevant vectors in real scenarios. In addition to demonstrating techniques and practical exploitation possibilities, the session may include a hands-on with installing and using Bruce, the open-source project maintained by the speaker.
