This talk investigates the **Shadow AI** phenomenon — the use of unauthorized or ungoverned Artificial Intelligence tools within organizations. The session explores how informal AI adoption introduces significant risks and hidden costs that go far beyond purely technical concerns.

Financial, psychological, and ecological impacts resulting from poor governance are analyzed, along with real-world examples of how these risks manifest in corporate environments. The presentation also discusses strategies and approaches to identify, mitigate, and integrate unofficial AI usage into responsible, transparent governance models aligned with business objectives.
