In this practical training, Fernando Mengali presents how creating scripts for NMAP can be used to identify and exploit *buffer overflow* vulnerabilities in network environments. The session addresses NMAP's role beyond traditional mapping, exploring its use as an offensive tool.

The talk demonstrates fundamental concepts of NMAP scripting applied to exploitation, connecting detection, validation, and attack in a practical workflow. This is the first part of a module focused on using automation for exploiting memory vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios.
