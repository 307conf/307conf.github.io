This talk provides an in-depth analysis of Artificial Intelligence systems from a risk, transparency, and responsibility perspective. The session aims to “open the AI black box,” exposing internal mechanisms, limitations, and vulnerabilities that are often overlooked.

Critical risks such as algorithmic bias, lack of explainability, unexpected behavior, and unintended impacts are examined. In addition, the presentation discusses practical methodologies for auditing, risk assessment, and mitigation, helping professionals navigate the complexity of AI in a more conscious, ethical, and responsible manner.
