The talk covers the state-of-the-art of Chrome’s current mitigations for memory corruptions in V8 — such as v8sbx — and tells the full story behind the discovery of CVE-2024-1283, a heap overflow in the image decoding process of Blink, Chrome’s rendering engine.

Jorge Buzeti then details the exploitation process, which required developing a new Cross Cache technique in PartitionAlloc. The session shows how to exploit browsers by looking beyond JavaScript and highlights how different Chrome subsystems can become relevant vectors for research and exploitation.
