In this talk, Anne Isabelle “Anya” Lovelace shares her reflections on the journey of being a hacker “for fun and not profit.” Drawing on her security research into Google devices — such as Chromecast and Google Home — and the publication of the article *Hacking Inacabado de Verão* on Tramoia.sh, Anya revisits discoveries, unfinished processes, and the paths that time ends up diverting.

The presentation discusses how curiosity guides a hacker’s work, how the market sometimes prunes creativity, and how it is still possible to go further — picking up interrupted projects and continuing the work of those who came before. A candid conversation about hacking, community, legacy, and a passion for exploration.
