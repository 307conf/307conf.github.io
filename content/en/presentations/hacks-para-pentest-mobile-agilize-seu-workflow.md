This presentation covers practical strategies to optimize mobile pentesting workflows, starting with the distinction between pentesting and bug bounty, highlighting their different goals and approaches. The talk walks through the entire workflow, from environment preparation — proxy, certificates, physical devices or emulators — to static analysis, dynamic analysis, and API validation.

The session presents lab setups and essential tools such as adb, apktool, jadx, frida-tools, and objection, along with static and dynamic reverse engineering techniques using Frida. It also covers APK (re)signing with APKLab and UberApkSigner, automation of daily tasks using ZSH functions, and VSCode snippets.

The talk concludes with a practical analysis pattern, common mobile pentest findings, tips for writing more compelling reports, quick troubleshooting techniques, and resources for continued learning.
