After understanding the fundamentals of *buffer overflow* and the exploitation techniques presented throughout the track, this training focuses on the practical creation of exploit modules for the Metasploit framework.

The session shows how to structure, develop, and integrate custom exploits into Metasploit, covering best practices, development workflow, and validation. The goal is to empower participants to turn manual exploits into reusable tools, consolidating their learning in *exploit development* and offensive automation.
