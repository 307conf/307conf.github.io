In this second part of the practical training, participants will move from exploiting traditional services to the context of web servers. The session addresses how *buffer overflow* vulnerabilities can arise in this type of environment and what specific particularities need to be considered during analysis and exploitation.

The talk maintains a practical focus, connecting memory exploitation concepts to real-world web application scenarios, consolidating the learning started in Part 1 and preparing the ground for more advanced *exploit development* techniques.
