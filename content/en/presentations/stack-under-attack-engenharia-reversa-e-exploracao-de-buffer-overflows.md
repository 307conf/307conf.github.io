In this presentation, a vulnerable executable will be reverse-engineered to demonstrate, step-by-step, how to identify and understand a *stack-based buffer overflow* flaw. The talk covers the entire binary analysis process, from initial inspection to the precise discovery of the vulnerability.

Throughout the session, Vinícius Martins presents the complete construction of a functional exploit in a controlled environment, explaining how this type of flaw arises, how it can be exploited in practice, and what impacts it can cause. The objective is to offer a practical and didactic view of memory vulnerability exploitation, connecting theory and practice to strengthen the security of real systems.
