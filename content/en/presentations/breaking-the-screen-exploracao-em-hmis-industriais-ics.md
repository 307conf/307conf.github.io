In this talk, Joel Rossi explores attacks targeting industrial human-machine interfaces (HMIs), demonstrating how corrupting the interface can lead to critical impacts in ICS/OT environments. The presentation covers protocol class abuse, module injection, and memory flaws, such as *out-of-bounds* and *buffer overflow*, with the potential for remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS).

The session connects concepts of binary exploitation and firmware reverse engineering to the industrial context, showing how HMI vulnerabilities can be exploited in practice and what real risks they pose to critical infrastructures.
