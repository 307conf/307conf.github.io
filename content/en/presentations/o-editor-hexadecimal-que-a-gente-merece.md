Hex editors have existed for decades, and there are countless paid, free, and open-source options available. Yet, there is still room for innovation. In this talk, I introduce **dz6**, a command-line hex editor with a textual interface that is fast both in execution and workflow, thanks to heavy use of vim-style keyboard shortcuts.

Beyond being a hex editor you never have to leave the terminal to use, dz6 aims to revive a sense of Brazilian tool-building culture — something that was strong in the past but feels nearly forgotten today. In this session, you’ll see how dz6 features such as comments and string listing can help in real reverse engineering scenarios, malware analysis, and more.
