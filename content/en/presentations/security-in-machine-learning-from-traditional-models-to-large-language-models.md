In this talk, Erikson addresses security in Machine Learning from an evolutionary perspective, connecting known threats in traditional models to the new risks introduced by Large Language Models (LLMs).

The session explores attack vectors, design flaws, and emerging challenges, offering a clear vision of how AI security needs to adapt to the growing complexity of these systems.
