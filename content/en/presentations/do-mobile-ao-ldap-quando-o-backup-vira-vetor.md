In this talk, Davi Trindade will present a real case of certificate pinning bypass — performed without Frida and without altering the APK in a Flutter application — that revealed write access to corporate LDAP, enabling ATO, OTP bypass, and function lockout.  
It is a study of how mobile architecture decisions reverberate through the core of the business and how small shortcuts in legacy integrations open doors to high-risk impacts — even when “the pinning is ok.”
