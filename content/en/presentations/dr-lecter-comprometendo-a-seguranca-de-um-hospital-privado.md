## Introduction
During an adversary simulation exercise, Blaze Information Security engineers — posing as a doctor and a patient — successfully compromised the security of a private hospital. The operation exposed critical weaknesses in physical access controls, allowing unauthorized entry into restricted areas, theft of legitimate employee badges, execution of a “USB candy drop” attack, and deployment of a malicious device inside the hospital’s internal network. The absence of rigorous identity verification mechanisms, combined with excessive trust placed in visual cues that suggested medical staff affiliation, highlighted the environment’s susceptibility to attacks rooted in social engineering.

## Objective
This presentation aims to demonstrate the importance of incorporating physical security assessments into adversary simulations, especially in critical environments such as hospitals. By reconstructing this case study, it becomes clear how an unlikely scenario — involving the simultaneous entry of a fake doctor and a fake patient — can result in severe security breaches. The simulation reinforces the need to combine effective physical controls with robust identity verification processes and adequate staff preparedness to mitigate risks related to unauthorized access, preserving the integrity of hospital infrastructure, sensitive information, and the people who depend on it.
