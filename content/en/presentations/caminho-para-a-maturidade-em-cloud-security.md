Cloud security requires a modern, progressive, and business-aligned approach. In this talk, Wagner Azevedo presents a **Cloud Security Maturity Framework** based on **Zero Trust principles** and **continuous automation of policies and responses**.

The journey starts with identity strengthening, progresses through context-aware dynamic controls, and culminates in automated governance and security as code. Throughout the session, attendees will learn how to align strategy, operations, and technology to move from a purely reactive model to a more autonomous and resilient security posture.

The presentation is grounded in real-world practices and platforms such as **AWS, Azure, GitHub, Cortex Cloud, Wiz**, and **SOAR / XSIAM** tools, offering practical insights applicable to modern enterprise cloud environments.
