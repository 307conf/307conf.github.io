In this practical training, Fernando Mengali introduces the protection mechanisms based on the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) applied to *buffer overflow* vulnerabilities. The session explains how these protections work internally and why, in certain scenarios, they can still be exploited.

Throughout the presentation, he demonstrates how to bypass SEH protections to achieve code execution and system access, connecting theoretical concepts to practical *exploit development* techniques. This is the first part of a module focused on exploiting SEH-based overflows.
