The talk explores quantum computing and how its convergence with Artificial Intelligence can profoundly transform cryptography and digital security. The advance of these technologies raises the scenario known as Q-Day — the moment when current cryptographic mechanisms may no longer be reliable.

In this session, Luigi Polidorio presents the expected impacts of this new paradigm, discusses real risks to information security, and highlights how the combination of AI and quantum computing can both break existing models and drive new protection approaches.
