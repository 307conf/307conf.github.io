In this talk, Zoziel Freire shares the challenges encountered when developing malware for macOS, detailing how the Apple ecosystem imposes technical barriers from startup to binary execution. The session covers the role of *launchd* in persistence, how Gatekeeper and Notarization work, the limitations imposed by the native firewall, and high-level protections such as SIP (System Integrity Protection) and XProtect.

The talk also contextualizes macOS as a target, comparing its particularities with Windows and Linux and discussing the real motivations behind the growing attacker interest in the platform. Each defense mechanism demands specific evasion techniques, and Zoziel demonstrates in practice how these layers affect the development and ongoing adaptation of malicious code.

The presentation includes real demos, evasion techniques, strategies to maintain C2 channels, and analyses of how Apple’s native protections — and market security tools — influence the malware development lifecycle.
