In this talk, we dive into the inner workings of NFC contactless payments using the EMV protocol. Penegui demonstrates how, through intelligent manipulation of EMV tags, it is possible to bypass the PIN requirement in high-value transactions. 

Using practical examples and a technical breakdown of how payment devices communicate, the session explores legal and safe methods for understanding — and potentially probing — existing security gaps, encouraging a critical reflection on the robustness of modern payment systems.
