SCADA systems are present in various industry sectors and play a critical role in the operation of essential infrastructures. In this practical training, Fernando Mengali presents how *buffer overflow* vulnerabilities can arise in this type of environment and what particularities differentiate exploitation in industrial systems from other contexts.

The session covers analysis and exploitation techniques applied to ICS/SCADA systems, demonstrating in practice how memory flaws can be exploited and what real impacts this can have on industrial environments. The objective is to broaden the understanding of vulnerability exploitation in critical scenarios, uniting *exploit development* and industrial security.
