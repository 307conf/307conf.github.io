In this hands-on training, participants will learn the fundamentals of exploiting classic (*vanilla*) *buffer overflow* vulnerabilities, using FTP servers as a case study. The presentation covers the essential concepts, from understanding the flaw to building the exploit.

The session is focused on practice and didactics, connecting theory and real-world exploitation, serving as a solid foundation for those who want to advance in *exploit development* and memory corruption vulnerabilities.
