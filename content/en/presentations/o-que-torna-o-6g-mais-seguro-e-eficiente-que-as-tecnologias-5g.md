5G brought important advances in latency, spectral efficiency, and speed, but it still relies on a high number of antennas to ensure large-scale coverage. 6G, on the other hand, introduces a revolutionary traffic model by embedding AI-driven self-protection directly into the RAN infrastructure. These intelligent agents can detect anomalies — such as DoS, spoofing, and intrusion attempts — and can adapt routes and predict failures in real time at the network edge.

In security, 6G makes post-quantum cryptography (PQC) a priority, with the possibility of integrating QKD (Quantum Key Distribution) protocols in extremely critical scenarios. However, adopting 6G in Brazil faces technical, regulatory, economic, and social challenges that must be addressed for the technology to deliver as a concrete protection tool in everyday use.

The talk weaves together three pillars — 6G networks, quantum security, and AI in the infrastructure — to show why the future of information security tends to shift toward hardware, and which innovations 6G brings over 5G with a direct impact on society’s development.
