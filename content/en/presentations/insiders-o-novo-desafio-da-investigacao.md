The talk addresses the growing challenge posed by insiders in digital and corporate investigations. Unlike external attackers, insiders have legitimate access, knowledge of the environment, and the ability to cause significant damage without raising immediate alarms.

The session discusses the investigative, behavioral, and technical aspects involved in identifying, mitigating, and holding insiders accountable for internal threats, connecting digital investigation, information security, and the legal context.
