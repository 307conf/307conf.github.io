In this session, João Vitor (@keowu) will present the **Ryūjin** research, showing how Bin2Bin tools work internally to apply layers of obfuscation to Windows PE x64 executables.

He demonstrates how to identify common artifacts in these pipelines, how to automate detection with YARA, and how an attacker can abuse these techniques to evade traditional security engines.
